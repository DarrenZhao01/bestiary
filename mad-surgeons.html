                <h2>Summary of Get Out</h2>
                <p>
                    Get Out is Jordan Peele's film debut in horror. The movie follows Chris being invited to meet his girlfriend's parents. What seems to be a calm getaway quickly spirals into unnerving, and Chris doesn't know who is friend or foe. Spoilers: Chris realizes he is a target for surgery that would cause him to lose his mind, rendering him a zombie. He is forced to confront his girlfriend and her family to escape.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <div class="quote">
                    <span>"By the way, I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could. Best president in my lifetime. Hands down." -Dean Armitage</span>

                <p>
                    The people who are performing the surgeries are the root of the zombie. Although not formal diseases, they are still integral to creating a zombie. The Armitage family comprises a psychiatrist (mother) and a surgeon (father)—both attempt to ensure Chris that they are progressive, ultimately alienating Chris further. The family profits off of the surgeries by bidding on kidnapped bodies. The idea of bidding for control of a person’s body parallels the history of slavery in the U.S.

                <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
                <p>

                    The critical thing to point out about the psycho family from Get Out is what they reveal about our modern society. Jordan Peele, the director of Get Out, purposely inserted moments where the family would try to prove they are not racist. From the father saying he voted for Obama to the daughter being overprotective of Chris until the betrayal. All of these moments reflect the modern world in which people believe that superficial actions will make people seem better than they are. However, because someone voted for Obama is proof of that anti-discrimination, which is shallow. It highlights a society where people are more focused on what they appear to be than what they are. This society parallels the real world and how these superficial beliefs are still prominent to people in the 2010s-2020s. In the attempts of the Armitage family to attempt to look progressive, they ultimately alienate the people they pander to because they have warped and preconceived views of others and hardly believe what they try to appear. This fear of people trying to act gilded, masking their true intentions, demonstrates that these issues are still relevant in the 2010s.
