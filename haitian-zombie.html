            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                The Haitian zombie originates from Vodou, a religion born from the blending of African spiritual
                practices with Catholicism. It was also shaped by the transatlantic slave trade and Haiti’s colonial
                history. In Vodou, death involves the separation of the body and soul, and if proper burial rites are
                not performed, the body becomes vulnerable to being turned into a zombie. This belief reflects the
                importance of familial and ancestral connections in Haitian culture. The zombie narrative also draws
                heavily from Haiti’s history of slavery and revolution, mirroring the lived experiences of
                dehumanization and forced servitude under colonial rule.
            </p>
            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <div class="quote">
                <span>"The few who do see zombies as concrete reality do not fear the zombies themselves (who are only mindless and pathetic); rather, they fear becoming a zombie under the wrong circumstances and against their will."</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                The Haitian zombie is characterized by its lifeless, soulless being entirely under the control of a
                bokor (Vodou sorcerer). It cannot act or think independently, functioning solely as a tool or servant
                for the bokor's purposes. Physically, Haitian zombies appear intact but display a blank stare and
                sluggish movements. Unlike Western depictions of zombies as grotesque, decaying monsters, Haitian
                zombies are subdued and non-violent, serving their master rather than causing chaos. They are created by
                magical rituals, which sever the connection between body and soul.
            </p>
            <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
            <p>
                The Haitian zombie is deeply rooted in the country's cultural, historical, and socio-political
                experiences, particularly the legacy of slavery, colonialism, and Vodou traditions. The zombie embodies
                the belief in the soul's separation from the body after death. Without proper rituals, the body becomes
                vulnerable to manipulation, symbolizing a loss of agency. This concept reflects the dehumanization
                experienced by enslaved Haitians, whose bodies were once controlled and exploited, mirroring the
                zombie's lack of autonomy and freedom. Following Haiti's successful revolution and independence in 1804,
                the zombie narrative evolved into a metaphor for fears of losing autonomy under oppressive systems.
                Additionally, it reflects a cultural fear of social isolation, as Haitian society places immense value
                on maintaining connections with family and ancestors. To become a zombie is to be stripped of identity
                and purpose, and they will live in complete isolation and servitude.
