                <h2>Summary of Zone One</h2>
                <p>

                    Colson Whitehead's Zone One occurs in a post-apocalyptic world that centers on a zombie hunter, Mark
                    Spitz. The postmodern world still has characteristics like consumerism and multimedia, now in
                    conjunction with a zombie outbreak. The story takes place in Manhattan and follows the survivors'
                    efforts to rebuild humanity.
                </p>
                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                <div class="quote">
                    <span>“They were a succession of imponderable tableaux, the malfunctioning stragglers and the places
                        they chose to haunt throughout the Zone and beyond. An army of mannequins, limbs adjusted by an
                        inscrutable hand. The former shrink, plague-blind, sat in her requisite lounge chair, feet up on
                        the ottoman, blank attentive face waiting for the patient who was late, ever late, and unpacking
                        the reasons for this would consume a large portion of a session that would never occur”
                        (Whitehead 46).</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The zombies in Zone One are called skels. They are primarily characterized as pale and leucistic.
                    Notable symptoms include loss of logic to a mindless state that constantly tries to attack survivors
                    and likes to be in herds. The second kind of skels, known as the stragglers, are almost in this
                    catatonic state, in which they are not as aggressive and usually repeat tasks that could be related
                    to their previous life. In both instances, the skels slowly decay.
                </p>
                <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
                <p>
                    The active skels are characterized by their horde-like nature, embodying the fear of mob mentality
                    and the absence of individuality in a crowd. This serves as a commentary on culture in the United
                    States. While the U.S. is celebrated as a cultural melting pot, this blending can often dilute the
                    unique qualities of its constituent cultures, losing the essence of the distinctiveness that built
                    it. Similarly, the skels symbolize a loss of individuality, evoking an underlying sadness. The
                    narrator perceives them as people who once had hopes and dreams, now stripped of what made them
                    unique, blending into an indistinguishable mass. Zone One uses the skels to critique postmodern
                    fears of losing identity, being reduced to a mere cog in the machine, or being a drop in the ocean.
                    They highlight the dangers of a reality where diversity becomes homogenized, erasing the richness of
                    difference.
