            <h1>Shen Fever</h1>
            <h3>Severance by Ling Ma</h3>
            <br>

            <h2>Summary of Severance</h2>
            <p>

                In "Severance," Candace Chen is a routine-driven millennial working in book production in New York
                City when a mysterious pandemic called Shen Fever begins to spread globally. Unlike typical deadly
                diseases, this virus causes infected individuals to become trapped in endless loops of familiar
                tasks—cooking the same meal repeatedly, cleaning the same room obsessively—until they ultimately
                die.
                As the world gradually collapses around her, Candace continues working, documenting the pandemic's
                progression through her job managing Bible production in Chinese factories. Her narrative alternates
                between two timelines: her life before the pandemic and her post-apocalyptic survival journey.
                When civilization ultimately crumbles, Candace joins a group of survivors led by Bob, a former IT
                manager. This ragtag group travels across a devastated America, seeking a potential safe haven. Bob
                establishes strict rules and hierarchies within the group, ironically mirroring the corporate
                structures they've left behind.
                Candace's personal history as a first-generation Chinese-American adds depth to her survival story.
                Flashbacks reveal her immigrant parents' experiences and her own somewhat detached relationship with
                her cultural heritage. Her pragmatic, almost emotionally distant approach to the apocalypse sets her
                apart from typical survivalist protagonists.
                The group's journey is fraught with challenges: scarce resources, interpersonal conflicts, and the
                ever-present threat of becoming infected with Shen Fever. Throughout their travels, Candace reflects
                on her past life, her disconnection from meaningful relationships, and the soul-crushing nature of
                her pre-pandemic corporate existence.
                As they search for a potential settlement, the survivors confront the remnants of a world destroyed
                not just by a virus, but by the repetitive, meaningless routines that defined modern life.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <div class="quote">
                <span>“In its initial stages, Shen Fever is difficult to detect. Early symptoms include memory lapse,
                    headaches, disorientation, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Because these symptoms are often
                    mistaken for the common cold, patients are often unaware they have contracted Shen Fever. They may
                    appear functional and are still able to execute rote, everyday tasks. However, these initial
                    symptoms will worsen” (Ma 14).</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Shen Fever is a non-transmitted disease caused by a fungal spore infection. The disease originated in
                China and caused a worldwide pandemic. The disease is noted to cause the infected to repeat tasks. It
                also seems to be triggered by waves of nostalgia, usually when people enter a location that has meaning
                to their past.
            </p>
            <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
            <p>

                Shen Fever has specific characteristics that illustrate the themes of Severance, such as its origin in
                China. The world responds by applying pressure to China, and it correlates with the idea of Western
                racism towards Asian Americans. This is quite similar to COVID-19 and how Asian Americans were dealt
                with vitriol despite having almost no basis. The only factor that led to unfair pressure was the virus's
                origin. Additionally, the symptoms of Shen fever are zombification through repeating past actions, and
                the trigger for the disease is nostalgia. This symbolizes how nostalgia can lead people to be stuck in
                the past, similar to the effect on zombies. The virus shows a historical context of prejudice and
                exploitation of Asian
                Americans, which was still prevalent when Severance was published.
