            <h2>Description/Context</h2>
            <div class="quote">
                <span>Haitian Vodou encompasses a rich tapestry of roles, each integral to its communal and spiritual
                    practices. The hounsi are the backbone of the Haitian Vodou congregation. Most of the attendees at
                    any Vodou ceremony will be hounsi; they will sing the songs, dance the dances and welcome the lwa
                    when they come" (KiwiMojo).</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Vodou is one of Haiti's cultural identifiers. Practitioners perform rituals and ceremonies to practice
                the Haitian belief system. Some of its mythology was still developing during Haiti's revolution. Vodou
                is usually community-oriented and practices healing. It has a belief system of spirituality with various
                roles like Bòkò (Sorcerer), Houngan (Priest), Hounsi (Initiates), and much more.

            <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
            <p>
                The zombi is not a disease; Vodou practitioners usually cause it. These practitioners represent a blend
                of African cultures that assimilated into Haiti. They show the fear of slavery and are more spiritually
                attuned. It is an essential part of Haitian culture, and knowing about Haitian zombies can teach us
                about the Haitian belief system at that time and how it continues to live today. There are people today
                who continue the legacy of Vodou; however, instead of slavery, social issues are prominent. The change
                from Vodou to Voodoo in the U.S. has caused an over-exaggeration of darker elements, causing Vodou and
                its practitioners to be perceived negatively. This culture change demonstrates pressing issues in the
                21st century about how practices can be diluted.
