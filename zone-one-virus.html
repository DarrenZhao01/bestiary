            <h1>Zone One Virus</h1>
            <h3>Zone One by Colson Whitehead</h3>
            <br>

            <h2>Summary of Zone One</h2>
            <p>
                Colson Whitehead's Zone One occurs in a post-apocalyptic world that centers on a zombie hunter, Mark
                Spitz. The postmodern world still has characteristics like consumerism and multimedia, now in
                conjunction with a zombie outbreak. The story takes place in Manhattan and follows the survivors'
                efforts to rebuild humanity.
            </p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <div class="quote">
                <span>"Their lives had been an interminable loop of repeated gestures; now their existences were winnowed to the discrete and internal moment" (p. 62).</span>

            <p>
                More than many of its previous incarnations, the virus specializes in creating hordes. This virus has already conquered humanity, and it has focused on making as many rampaging zombies as possible. There isn’t much information about the virus; however, we can get an idea by looking at its symptoms. The virus causes some people to continue their day-to-day activities. It parallels how simple it is for people to form habits and never change from them, ultimately lacking any variation and individuality. They also echo unresolved experiences that bite away from a person’s psyche, preventing them from growing. The distinction of zombie types allows the virus to employ both a sense of danger with zombies and the depressing aspect of zombies repeating routines.
            </p>
            <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the virus wins in the end, and it shows the story has a more pessimistic view of the trajectory of our world. The virus tells us that the author feared that his society would be heading towards a loss of diversity. If the skels show a lack of individuality, the virus's outcome demonstrates that it has the power to bring about the collapse of our world. The virus represents a fear of postmodern society losing variation in 2011 when Zone One was published. Additionally, because the virus is focused on making as many zombies as possible, it portrays the loss of diversity will increase from 2011 and beyond.
