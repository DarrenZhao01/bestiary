            <h1>African Rabies (World War Z Virus)</h1>
            <h3>World War Z (WWZ) by Marc Forster</h3>
            <br>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                World War Z follows the “African rabies” outbreak as it is publicly revealed in China. It escalates
                towards spreading through black markets and trade. Various social issues stem from the pandemic, with
                countries like Russia, China, and America altering social policies differently. These alterations
                initially emphasize maintaining stability over protecting people. Ultimately, various sacrifices are
                made by both social institutions and individuals, alongside a global effort to save humanity.
            </p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <div class="quote">
                <span>“Ignorance was the enemy. Lies and superstition, misinformation, disinformation. Sometimes, no
                    information at all. Ignorance killed billions of people. Ignorance caused the Zombie War. Imagine if
                    we had known then what we know now. Imagine if the undead virus had been as understood as, say,
                    tuberculosis was. Imagine if the world's citizens, or at least those charged with protecting those
                    citizens, had known exactly what they were facing. Ignorance was the real enemy, and cold, hard
                    facts were the weapons” (Whitehead 83)</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                The virus creates powerful and hyperactive zombies. However, the virus is able to succeed so well
                because of international connections, alongside governments undermining its existence, and the world
                consequently being unprepared for it. The virus works on a cellular level to turn people into zombies in
                seconds. The only way to stop it is sanctioning.
            </p>
            <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
            <p>
                African rabies reflects a fear of nature, hence why it's not perceived as a biological weapon. It shows
                a fear of the unknown and how nature fights against human impact. Additionally, the disease is booming
                due to global corruption from ignorance, denial of the disease, and human exploitation, which are all
                issues relevant in the 21st century.
