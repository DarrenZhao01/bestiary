            <h1>African Rabies</h1>
            <h3>World War Z (WWZ) by Marc Forster</h3>
                <br>

                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>

                    In "Severance," Candace Chen is a routine-driven millennial working in book production in New York
                    City when a mysterious pandemic called Shen Fever begins to spread globally. Unlike typical deadly
                    diseases, this virus causes infected individuals to become trapped in endless loops of familiar
                    tasks—cooking the same meal repeatedly, cleaning the same room obsessively—until they ultimately
                    die.
                    As the world gradually collapses around her, Candace continues working, documenting the pandemic's
                    progression through her job managing Bible production in Chinese factories. Her narrative alternates
                    between two timelines: her life before the pandemic and her post-apocalyptic survival journey.
                    When civilization ultimately crumbles, Candace joins a group of survivors led by Bob, a former IT
                    manager. This ragtag group travels across a devastated America, seeking a potential safe haven. Bob
                    establishes strict rules and hierarchies within the group, ironically mirroring the corporate
                    structures they've left behind.
                    Candace's personal history as a first-generation Chinese-American adds depth to her survival story.
                    Flashbacks reveal her immigrant parents' experiences and her own somewhat detached relationship with
                    her cultural heritage. Her pragmatic, almost emotionally distant approach to the apocalypse sets her
                    apart from typical survivalist protagonists.
                    The group's journey is fraught with challenges: scarce resources, interpersonal conflicts, and the
                    ever-present threat of becoming infected with Shen Fever. Throughout their travels, Candace reflects
                    on her past life, her disconnection from meaningful relationships, and the soul-crushing nature of
                    her pre-pandemic corporate existence.
                    As they search for a potential settlement, the survivors confront the remnants of a world destroyed
                    not just by a virus, but by the repetitive, meaningless routines that defined modern life. The novel
                    culminates in a powerful exploration of survival, identity, and the thin line between existing and
                    truly living.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <div class="quote">
                    <span></span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The fevered in Ling Ma's novel are characterized by their haunting, zombie-like state of perpetual
                    repetition. Unlike traditional zombies driven by hunger or aggression, these infected individuals
                    become trapped in familiar routines from their past lives—meticulously recreating a specific
                    domestic scene or work task over and over again until they ultimately waste away. A middle-aged
                    woman might endlessly watching TV, a factory worker might continue assembling the same product, or
                    an office employee might repeatedly type the same documents, each movement becoming progressively
                    more mechanical and degraded. Their actions are less about survival and more about a compulsive
                    reenactment of muscle memory, suggesting a profound emptiness where conscious thought and agency
                    once existed.
                </p>
                <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
                <p>

                    The fevered represents people who are already metaphorically "infected" by the culture of corporate
                    systems that value consistent productivity over human complexity. By transforming this abstract
                    cultural critique into a physical manifestation of endless, purposeless repetition, the Fevered
                    reflect how capitalism conditions individuals to become essentially mindless robots, performing
                    tasks without genuine engagement or understanding of their broader purpose.
