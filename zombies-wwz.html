            <h2>Summary of WWZ</h2>
            <p>
                World War Z follows the “African rabies” outbreak as it is publicly revealed in China. It escalates
                towards spreading through black markets and trade. Various social issues stem from the pandemic, with
                countries like Russia, China, and America altering social policies differently. These alterations
                initially emphasize maintaining stability over protecting people. Ultimately, various sacrifices are
                made by both social institutions and individuals, alongside a global effort to save humanity.
            </p>
            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <div class="quote">
                <span>““By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from a history
                    that may, heaven forbid, lead us to one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the
                    only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'” (SuperSummary
                    2)</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                The zombies have a crucial characteristic of consumerism. The zombies are humans down to their primal
                instincts; however, their constant gouging reflects the modern consumerism culture of consuming
                entertainment or ideas without reflection and purpose. The zombies cause global systems to collapse,
                revealing how countries would react. World War Z also accurately depicts countries responding to a
                pandemic. The U.S. would struggle with believing if the pandemic was true or not. There would be a
                global sanction and more discrimination towards where the disease originated, denial and propaganda use
                from countries like China, isolationist policies, and a growing focus on political stability over
                well-being. These are similar to COVID-19. World War Z provides a what-if that tells us more about the
                weaknesses of countries like China, America, and Russia during a pandemic. These issues are only
                relevant to the time so that countries might react differently in the future. The fact that World War Z
                accurately predicted many events related to COVID-19 emphasizes the fear that the society in World War Z
                exists for real and that these societies could just as well fail as they did in the novel. It shows that
                the early 2000s, from the publishing of World War, were quite similar to the 2020s.

            <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
            <p>

                The fevered represents people who are already metaphorically "infected" by the culture of corporate
                systems that value consistent productivity over human complexity. By transforming this abstract
                cultural critique into a physical manifestation of endless, purposeless repetition, the Fevered
                reflect how capitalism conditions individuals to become essentially mindless robots, performing
                tasks without genuine engagement or understanding of their broader purpose.
