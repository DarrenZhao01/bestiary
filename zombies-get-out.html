            <h2>Summary of Get Out</h2>
            <p>
                Get Out is Jordan Peele's film debut in horror. The movie follows Chris being invited to meet his
                girlfriend's parents. What seems to be a calm getaway quickly spirals into unnerving, and Chris doesn't
                know who is friend or foe. Spoilers: Chris realizes he is a target for surgery that would cause him to
                lose his mind, rendering him a zombie. He is forced to confront his girlfriend and her family to escape.
            </p>
            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <div class="quote">
                <span>"Part of the desire to live in a post-racial world includes the desire not to have to talk about
                    racism, which includes a false perception that if you are talking about race, then you're
                    perpetuating the notion of race. I reject that." -Jordan Peele </span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Although not typical zombies, the victims of the brain transplants have some striking similarities.
                First and foremost, they lack control of their bodies, which is quite similar to the Haitian zombi.
                People who are a part of the surgery have their consciousness trapped in the “sunken place” in which
                another person controls their bodies. During Get Out, Chris' girlfriend lures him into a false sense of
                security, hoping to trap him in the “sunken place” forever.
            </p>
            <h2>Connection to its Culture</h2>
            <p>

                Akin to the Haitian zombi, the victims in Get Out are metaphors for slavery and discrimination in
                America. The surgery targeted black people for a superstitious reason and made it so their bodies would
                be used as tools for others, which echoes how enslaved people were treated similarly. Additionally, the
                victim maintains partial awareness, further cementing a feeling of fear and hopelessness. Zombies in Get
                Out reveal that even in the late 2010s, racial issues are still poignant in America. This gives us
                insight into a conflict between a perfect world and actual reality in the climate in which Get Out was
                created.
